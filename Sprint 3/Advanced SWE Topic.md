## Concept: Software Reuse

The group decided to follow a software reuse approach for component-based software engineering. This is because the medical appointment system was developed with many components that were cooperative with one another. Objects, functions, and data were those components. In particular, as seen in the architectural design, the layers were permitted to call upon other layers for the product to be successful. The group had a system class for the management of patients, doctors, appointments, illnesses, and specialties. This permits for accurately, efficiently categorizing illnesses and matching the patient with their respective specialty doctor.
