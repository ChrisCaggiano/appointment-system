# Mass Market Rollout

## Steps to release minor project for a mass-market:

1) Ensure that there is executable code of the programs used. In my group's case with the project, this means making sure that the medical appointment system code is  working properly. Also, all associated data files would have to be labeled and tagged with release identifiers.
2) Descriptions explicitly written for hardware and operating systems. This includes writing instructions on what/how the hardware and operating systems are utilized; basically like a "How to." An example would be how to use the patient portal for the doctors and patients to read.
3) More instructions written for users or clients that want to make their own systems with our major project.
4) How to install the Medical Appointment System. Where it is supported such as only on iOS, Android, Linux, etc. In this case, our app is accepted on all platforms.
5) System documentation and having web pages with release dates and what to expect with each release. In this case, Github Repo could be an example.
6) Create the final image of the software and give it to client/sales outlets. In this case, it would be the final product of the Medical Appointment system, user interface of Patient Portal with its sole intention to have potential patients make appointments based on their condition. They are then matched with a doctor within the illnessâ€™ specialty depending on their suspected condition. Additionally, no patient must remain unseen for more than 14 days under any conditions.
