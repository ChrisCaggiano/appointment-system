# Methods of Communication

## Discord:

Discord allowed us to communicate through voice calls as well as text chat. Through the use of different text channels, we were able to prioritize different information and announcements through different channels.
We had one central group chat where we generally communicated through, and several sub group chats that corresponded to different sections of the project
For this project, we met on three separate occasions (sprints) virtually on weekends

## Slack:

The group also utilized Slack for as a secondary communication source. This application was utilized to verify meetings or @ individuals for any important questions when one could not attend a meeting.
