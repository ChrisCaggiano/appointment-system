# Organization

Typically, each sprint began with run through of the requirements for our project. This is where we would clear the air and any confusion before our work session begins. Communication like this allows us to be on the same page and help mitigate any potential confusion.

Tools like Lucidchart, TeamGantt, Canva provided easy methods to create system models and charts. These sites also allowed us to cooperate with each other and add/edit each othersâ€™ models.

Each meeting we held on Discord would conclude with a quick recap on member responsibilities. The group would discuss what has been completed and what has not been completed. 

Each time we met, we would begin with going over the document from the beginning to see if there were potential mistakes or any information that were not included in the code that may change the requirements.
