# Post-Facto Risk Management Explanation

## Risk Management: Requirement Changes
	
- Description: As our group discussed the requirements specification, consisting of functional requirements and non-functional requirements, changes were required. This requirement risk was made to accommodate with a simpler approach for the rest of the sprints in the minor project. 
- Impact: These requirement changes affected the original plan and required alterations to following sprints of the major project. Details with architecture and system modeling were adjusted prior to coding the software. Additionally, this caused delays within our group’s original-planned sprint deadlines.
- Probability: Moderate
- Severity: Serious
- Mitigation strategy: The group had to set up a following meeting time to confirm that the changes with the requirements were feasible and adapted to a more simpler approach for the software sprint. It was crucial to touch upon each possible requirement and to all agree on which requirement (non-functional or functional) they belonged to. 

## Project Planning: Implementation of Requirements into the Code

- Description: It was a challenge to implement the code of what we planned each sprint, and this was especially the case with the first sprint as we naturally spent a lot more time brainstorming and planning the project without a clear direction of how the final code would end up looking and functioning.
- Impact: This risk prevents the future sprints to be harder for working on the project in terms of planning and implementation as the later sprints must make up for the time lost on the first.
- Probability: High
- Severity: Serious
- Mitigation strategy: As a result of this risk, the team had to work harder on the later sprints than we would’ve needed to if we put an equal amount of time and effort into the earlier sprints so that the later sprints wouldn’t have had to have been rushed. As a lesson from the first project though, the team also mitigated this risk ahead of time by setting small deadlines for each other to make sure we were keeping up with the work early on to not challenge us later as well as not making it more difficult for other members of the team.

## People Management: Consistently Planning Meetings

- Description: It was difficult to consistently plan and agree on meeting times due to the varied schedules of the team members. The initial plan for the frequency and dates of meeting thus had to change as the sprints went on to meet the needs of all the team members.
- Impact: Due to inconsistency in planning meetings, there were often times where people would just have to work on the project in segments on their own and this lessens the level of communication and coordination with the work done on the project, which results in the group communicating less effectively and having to communicate more, and plays into the other risks involved with project management.
- Probability: Moderate
- Severity: Tolerable
- Mitigation strategy: Once again, the team learned from the previous experience with the minor project and made a better use of our mediums of communication, namely iMessage and Discord. iMessage was used for urgent communication about getting us to meet together or any short term communication that didn’t require much back and forth. Discord was used for sending files, organizing long discussions and meetings, and getting everyone together and involved for sprints. We made sure to use iMessage more frequently to organize meeting times and made sure to make our communication efficient by turning our short term communication via text into calls for meetings.
