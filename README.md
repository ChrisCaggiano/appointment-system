# Group 13 Major Project----(Medical) Appointment System: Patient illness type with speciality

## Project Description
You've been asked by the newly formed Rutgers Health to create a patient-doctor appointment system. Create a system that categorizes illness into N categories and doctor medical specialization into M categories (where N > M). Ideally, every patient will get a doctor with the right speciality but that could result in long waiting times.  You will need to make necessary assumptions of the number of patients, the number of doctors, acceptable waiting times (say based upon illness type) etc. but no patient must remain unseen for more than 14 days under any conditions.
