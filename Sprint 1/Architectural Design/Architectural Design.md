# Architectural Design 

The groupâ€™s Architectural Design involves a layered information system. This was chosen to accommodate shared and cooperative databases for each layer. The top layer begins with the User Interface in which the users such as the patients or doctors will be able to interact with the computer medical system. The second layer serves as a Management, Authentication & Authorization is the user communications layer. This particular layer controls and monitors the input and output from the top layer, the user interface when patients or doctors utilize the medical appointment system. For instance, when the user logs into the patient portal, the purpose of the second layer is to authenticate and authorize the login information and ensure security is taken into place. The third layer handles logic for accessing and updating the databases that are present in the fourth layer. In this design, an upper level may need to proceed with interactions in the lower layers to work effectively. The architectural design and the conceptual view is displayed on the next page.
