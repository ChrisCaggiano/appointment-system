# Organization

## Patient Portal:

Patient enters one condition in the portal. Then, the patient is given all available options for appointments based on their condition selection. If there is no doctor available (whether that is due to lack of appointment space or no doctor available pertaining to that specialty) for the patientâ€™s selected condition, there will be no options listed on the portal. Additionally, the patient will have to make their appointment, if applicable 24 hours in advance. If any of these scenarios occur, the patient will then be redirected back to the home screen for the option to make a new appointment. Any appointments unscheduled by a patient or canceled appointments on the same day will not accept any fill-in slots. Once the patient selects the time and date, their name, illness, desired time/date will be logged in as data into the system. The patient will not receive any confirmation notifications through text or email.
