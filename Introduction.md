Introduction

The team was asked by the newly formed Rutgers Health to create a patient-doctor appointment system. The main purpose of this project is to create a system that categorizes illness into N categories and doctor medical specialization into M categories (where N > M). Ideally, every patient will get a doctor with their respective speciality but that could result in long waiting times. You will need to make necessary assumptions of the number of patients, the number of doctors, acceptable waiting times (say based upon illness type) etc. but no patient must remain unseen for more than 14 days under any conditions.
